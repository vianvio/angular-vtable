# angular-vtable
A table plugin which is a directive building with angularjs. The key feature is the column resizing and fix table heads.

To have a quick try, you may get help with a node module 'anywhere' -- npm install -g anywhere, then cd to the angular-vtable folder and code anywhere to start.
or grunt, or gulp, anything you like,
or you may add a nodejs server :)

I have added timeout when getting local json data, so it looks like it takes some time to get the data.

If any suggestion, please let me know ~ I will like it, thank you ~
